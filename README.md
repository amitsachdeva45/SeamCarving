# SeamCarving

It is algorithm to reduce size of image.  It functions by establishing a number of seams (paths of least importance) 
in an image and automatically removes seams to reduce image size or inserts seams to extend it. 
Seam carving also allows manually defining areas in which pixels may not be modified,
and features the ability to remove whole objects from photographs.
